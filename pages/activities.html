										<p>The main need and the general goal from which we developed the project “Great 4 MY Life”, according also with the general targets of the Erasmus+ program, is developing a lifestyle that is healthy, active, tolerant and involved. </p>
										<p> The specific objectives are: </p>
										<p> 1. Increasing the level of awareness to the importance of a healthy diet to our 42 participants (35 youngsters and 7 group leaders) from Bulgaria, Italy, Lithuania, Malta, Hungary, Turkey and Romania during the 11 days of activities </p>
										<p> 2. Understanding the importance of interaction and communication in community</p>
										<p> 3. Understanding the benefits of using sport such as an instrument of social inclusion</p>
										<p>Youngsters will develop basic competences of a lifestyle that is healthy, active, tolerant and involved and will have the possibilities to interact through the opportunities offered by the Erasmus+ program. The project will be based on informal and non-formal learning methods, will be participatory, experimental and will allow working in groups in interactive workshops.</p>

										<p>Youngsters will have the opportunity to discuss and to understand the importance and necessity of their involvement on long term in the problems of a healthy lifestyle, to find and even implement practical solutions for improving quality of life. </p>
										<p> Youth will be introduced to examples of good practice and new diet habits, so they will understand that marginalization and stereotypes can be exceeded, they will make physical activities and will learn to work in mix international teams. </p>
										<p>
											The project wants to put an accent on finding ideas that are creative and innovative through realizing a video material and a brochure from which the participants intend to send a message to the community.

								<h2> Youth Today </h2>

								<p> Our Association has identified among the young people who graduate high school or university a keen sense of disorientation regarding their future. </p>
								<p> One of the issues often recognized by young people is that there is a mismatch between the things learnt in school and the things they are required as experience on the labor market. </p>
								<p>
									The information presented during the courses are not relevant to the employers and their requirements are difficult to accomplish for a young graduate.</p>

										<p> The awareness that the information received in school will not bring an acceptable value for the society leads to an increasing number of graduates who drop courses trying "something else". </p>
										<p> However, some of these young people no longer find their place either in school or in society. </p>
										<p> This thing has as an effect, besides a low self-esteem, an increase of the unemployment among the youth and a very low level of their participation in the activities of the NGOs and the community. </p>
										<p> Together with the youth we have identified a very low degree of understanding the entrepreneurial opportunities offered by volunteering through non-formal education in their personal development. </p>
										<p>The lack of support provided to the young people in this direction leads to a static society, aged in terms of the involvement in the society.</p>
									</div>
									<!-- Text for Desktop Version Only -->
									<div class="text-desktop">
										<p>The young people will adapt to a new development process where they will be challenged so that their talent and skills to be put into value and to undertake something, to be entrepreneurs, thus contributing to the decrease of unemployment among young people.
										</p>
										<p> We can’t overlook the key concept of entrepreneurship, entrepreneurship education, a concept that supports the young people in order to do something, to put into practice the information, desires and experiences gained for managing their own project with various innovative activities.
										</p>
										<p>
											By this project a follow-up will be provided contributing to a good collaboration between the direct partners involved in this exchange, who wish to ensure the continuity of the project began with the funding of the Erasmus + project, bringing an adding value to the European community and multiplying the results at as many young people as possible.
